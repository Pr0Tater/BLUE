        <h2>Understanding Bioluminescence</h2>
        <p>Bioluminescence is the production and emission of light by living organisms. This phenomenon occurs in a variety of creatures, including fireflies, certain fungi, jellyfish, and deep-sea fish. The light emitted by these organisms is the result of a chemical reaction between a light-emitting molecule called luciferin and an enzyme called luciferase.</p>

        <p>In most cases, bioluminescence serves an ecological purpose. For example, fireflies use it to attract mates, while some deep-sea creatures use it to lure prey or communicate in the darkness of the ocean depths. The light produced can vary in color, ranging from blue to green to red, depending on the type of organism and the chemicals involved in the process.</p>

        <p>While bioluminescence is widespread in nature, it is particularly common in marine environments, where up to 90% of organisms in some ecosystems can produce light. It remains a subject of scientific study, as researchers continue to explore how organisms control this light and what potential uses bioluminescence might have in areas such as medicine and environmental monitoring.</p>
